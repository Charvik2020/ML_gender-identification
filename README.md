## Idea

Gender Identification has become area of extensive research
due to itâ€™s increasingly powerful applications. Moreover augmenting
it in real time scenario can be useful in many applications
in many fields. A successful gender classification could
have great impact in improving human computer interactions.
Practically it is imperative to improve the algorithms from time
to time in order to achieve higher accuracy levels and build
more accurate and robust systems.
